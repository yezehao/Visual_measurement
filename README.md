- [ ] Smoothing and Sharpening
- [ ] Edge Filter
- [ ] Frequency Domain Filter
- [ ] Image Segementation
- [ ] Edge Detection Operator about points and lines
- [ ] Morphological processing

## Week 2
Realise the size measurement of objects based on the principle of *Hough Transform*.
+ Programming Language: Python, MATLAB or C++
+ Learn the basic principle of *Hough Transform* 
+ Realise camera-based measurment based
